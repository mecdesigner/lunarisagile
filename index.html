      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">ðŸŒ• What is Lunaris?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Lunaris</strong> is inspired by the lunar cycleâ€”a natural, 4-week rhythm of renewal, growth, and reflection. Just like the moon moves through phases, Lunaris structures work into one in-person week of alignment and connection, followed by three weeks of focused remote execution. It's a cadence designed to balance presence and autonomy, strategy and action. The name reminds us that great teamwork, like nature, works best in cyclesâ€”not chaos.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accentdark dark:border-accent pl-4 text-accentdark dark:text-accent mb-4 italic">
        We are uncovering better ways to collaborate, ship great work, and stay connectedâ€”without burning out.
      </blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In a world that's increasingly remote, async, and noisy, we believe teams thrive when they combine human presence with focused, uninterrupted work.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">Through our experience, we have come to value:</p>
      <ul class="mb-4 space-y-2 list-disc pl-8">
        <li><b>In-person alignment</b> over constant video calls</li>
        <li><b>Deep, focused work</b> over busy-busy multitasking</li>
        <li><b>Asynchronous clarity</b> over real-time pressure</li>
        <li><b>Shared rhythm and autonomy</b> over micromanaged sprints</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="italic text-sm mb-8">That is, while there's value in the items on the right, we value those on the left more.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Principles of Monthly Flow</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 space-y-3">
        <li><b>We start together.</b> The first week of every month is our time to meet in person, get aligned, and set the mood. We think big, we plan smartâ€”and we reconnect.</li>
        <li><b>We protect deep work.</b> The next three weeks are for execution, free from distractions. No micromanagement. Just trust and flow.</li>
        <li><b>We communicate clearly.</b> We rely on async updates that respect everyoneâ€™s time zones and focus. Meetings are intentional, not default.</li>
        <li><b>We trust the team.</b> Once we set the goals, we let the teams take ownership. Itâ€™s not about tracking hoursâ€”itâ€™s about delivering value.</li>
        <li><b>We value our time.</b> Focus time is sacred. We minimize pings, context switching, and aimless syncs.</li>
        <li><b>We believe in presence.</b> One week together can charge a month of momentum. Itâ€™s not just about workâ€”itâ€™s about energy and culture.</li>
        <li><b>We reflect to grow.</b> Every month ends with a pause. What did we learn? What do we keep? What do we change?</li>
        <li><b>Weâ€™re human first.</b> Behind every avatar is a person. One in-person week gives us back the magic of real team bonding.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">How it Works</h2>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <b>Week 1 â€“ In-Person Immersion</b><br>
        Planning, vision alignment, retrospectives, and bonding. Everyone together, no distractions. Big-picture thinking, team energy, and shared purpose.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Weeks 2â€“4 â€“ Remote Deep Work</b><br>
        Execution time. Teams work autonomously toward monthly goals, with async updates and optional weekly check-ins.

    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">The Hybrid Flow Variant</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">An optional structure for teams that want a more sustainable pace and natural quarterly rhythm:</p>
      <div class="mb-4">
        <b>Hybrid Flow = 3 sprints + 1 reset week</b>
      </div>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><b>Every 3 sprints</b>, teams take a <b>reset week</b> â€” for cleanup, hackathons, documentation, training, or just breathing room.</li>
        <li>This creates <b>12 sprints/year</b> (4 quarters Ã— 3 sprints).</li>
        <li>Reset weeks keep things fresh, reduce burnout, and allow time for bigger-picture reflection.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="bg-accentdark dark:bg-accent rounded-xl text-bg dark:text-basedark p-4 font-mono mb-6 whitespace-pre">
| Sprint 1 | Sprint 2 | Sprint 3 | Reset Week |
| Sprint 4 | Sprint 5 | Sprint 6 | Reset Week |
| Sprint 7 | Sprint 8 | Sprint 9 | Reset Week |
| Sprint 10| Sprint 11| Sprint 12| Reset Week |
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Integrating Design Thinking</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">Monthly Flow integrates naturally with IBM's Enterprise Design Thinking loop:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><b>Observe:</b> Conduct user research and gather insights during the in-person week through workshops, interviews, and empathy mapping.</li>
        <li><b>Reflect:</b> Use the same week to align around insights, co-define problem statements, and frame "Hills" or shared objectives.</li>
        <li><b>Make:</b> Execute solutions, iterate on prototypes, and validate ideas throughout the remote weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This hybrid rhythm helps teams empathize, ideate, and deliverâ€”all with the right balance of collaboration and deep focus. The first week becomes a foundation for strategic thinking, while the rest of the month is optimized for execution and iteration.

        Lunaris creates a middle groundâ€”structured enough to maintain clarity and direction, but human enough to foster creativity and connection. Itâ€™s especially suited for <b>designers, product teams, and distributed teams</b> who want to lead with intention rather than react to endless status updates.

      <div class="mb-3">
        <b>Operations Teams</b><br>
